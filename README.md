## Full-Stack & AI Engineer 

I am a full-stack software engineer with a strong foundation in **Python and JavaScript** for backend and frontend development, complemented by a background in **automation and control engineering** in the petrochemical industry. I have expertise in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and a deep interest in **integrating AI into engineering systems** to optimize processes, control strategies, and decision-making.

I combine my engineering knowledge with modern software practices, including:

* **Frontend Development:** React, Vue.js, and dynamic user interfaces
* **Backend Development:** Python (Django, FastAPI), Node.js, REST/GraphQL APIs
* **AI & ML Integration:** NLP pipelines, RAG systems, computer vision, speech processing, Reinforcement Learning for control and optimization
* **DevOps Practices:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm Charts, GitHub Actions
* Currently expanding knowledge in **Terraform** and cloud-native infrastructure for scalable deployments

Across my projects, I work at the intersection of:

* **Full-stack systems engineering** (JS + Python, APIs, async processing, job queues)
* **AI-enhanced engineering systems** (automation, control, RL-driven optimization)
* **Production-grade architecture** (scalability, observability, fault tolerance)

## Core Engineering Themes

### 1. AI & Reinforcement Learning Integration

I design systems where **AI, especially RL, is applied to engineering and control problems**. This includes optimizing process parameters, autonomous decision-making, and predictive control in physical systems.

### 2. Full-Stack Development

Building interactive, responsive applications that leverage **Python and JS stacks**, ensuring seamless integration between frontend and AI-powered backend modules.
